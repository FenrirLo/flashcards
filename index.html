            <dd>Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a userâ€™s browser, etc.</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Operators">
            <dt>Operators</dt>
            <dd>An operator, in computer programing, is a symbol that usually represents an action or process. These symbols were adapted from mathematics and logic. An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand. Operators are the backbone of any program and they are used for everything from very simple functions like counting to complex algorithms like security encryption.</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Variables">
            <dt>Variables</dt>
            <dd>A variable, in the context of programming, is a symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents. A variable is assigned a value in one place and then used repetitively. Variables generally have four attributes: an identifier, data location, type and value. They are assigned during program execution at different times. In a few instances, non-identical identifiers may refer to the same location, variable, and value. Variable types specify the kind of information stored in a variable. They also describe the format of the value stored, memory occupied, and methods for manipulating and expressing the content.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Naming">
            <dt>Variable Naming Conventions</dt>
            <dd>Naming conventions are general rules applied when creating text scripts for software programming. They have many different purposes, such as adding clarity and uniformity to scripts, readability for third-party applications, and functionality in certain languages and applications. They range from capitalization and punctuation to adding symbols and identifiers to signify certain functions.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Functions">
            <dt>Functions</dt>
            <dd>Within a greater code structure, a function, which also may be called a subroutine or procedure, is "called" by the code, depending on a user event or as part of a greater operation. When called, the function operates on the inputs and produces the results.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Methods">
            <dt>Methods</dt>
            <dd>A method, in the context of object-oriented programming, is a procedure or function associated with a class. As part of a class, a method defines a particular behavior of a class instance. A class can have more than one method.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Arguments">
            <dt>Arguments</dt>
            <dd>In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Parameters">
            <dt>Parameters</dt>
            <dd>A parameter is a special kind of variable in computer programming language that is used to pass information between functions or procedures. The actual information passed is called an argument."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Returns">
            <dt>Returns</dt>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Chaining">
            <dt>Chaining Methods</dt>
            <dd>Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results."</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Strings">
            <dt>Strings</dt>
            <dd>In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation)."</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Booleans">
            <dt>Booleans</dt>
            <dd>Boolean refers to a system of logical thought that is used to create true/false statements. A Boolean value expresses a truth value (which can be either true or false). Boolean expressions use the operators AND, OR, XOR and NOT to compare values and return a true or false result."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Undefined">
            <dt>Undefined</dt>
            <dd>Undefined variable. An undefined variable is a variable that is used in a program that has not been previously declared in the source code. In most programming languages, this results in an error. With this in place, the x variable won't have a value of "undefined"."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="NaN">
            <dt>NaN</dt>
            <dd>Not a Number (NaN) represents an undefined number in floating-point operations. A Not a Number indicator may also be a sign that a variable that is supposed to be a numerical value has been corrupted by text characters or symbols."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Escape">
            <dt>Escape</dt>
            <dd>In computing and telecommunication, an escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgment of whether something is an escape character or not depends on context."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Alert">
            <dt>Alert</dt>
            <dd>In JavaScript, an alert is a type of "pop-up" message to users of a script. ... They can also be helpful to JavaScript programmers as a means of debugging a script. By using an alert message to display values, the programmer can determine where things may be going wrong in a script through the process of elimination."</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Comments">
            <dt>Comments</dt>
            <dd>In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters."</dd>
