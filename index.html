            <dd>Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a userâ€™s browser, etc.</dd>

            <dt>Operators</dt>
            <dd>An operator, in computer programing, is a symbol that usually represents an action or process. These symbols were adapted from mathematics and logic. An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand. Operators are the backbone of any program and they are used for everything from very simple functions like counting to complex algorithms like security encryption.</dd>

            <dt>Variables</dt>
            <dd>A variable, in the context of programming, is a symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents. A variable is assigned a value in one place and then used repetitively. Variables generally have four attributes: an identifier, data location, type and value. They are assigned during program execution at different times. In a few instances, non-identical identifiers may refer to the same location, variable, and value. Variable types specify the kind of information stored in a variable. They also describe the format of the value stored, memory occupied, and methods for manipulating and expressing the content.</dd>

          <dl class="hidecontent" id="Naming">
            <dt>Variable Naming Conventions</dt>
            <dd>Naming conventions are general rules applied when creating text scripts for software programming. They have many different purposes, such as adding clarity and uniformity to scripts, readability for third-party applications, and functionality in certain languages and applications. They range from capitalization and punctuation to adding symbols and identifiers to signify certain functions.</dd>

            <dt>Functions</dt>
            <dd>Within a greater code structure, a function, which also may be called a subroutine or procedure, is "called" by the code, depending on a user event or as part of a greater operation. When called, the function operates on the inputs and produces the results.</dd>

            <dd>A method, in the context of object-oriented programming, is a procedure or function associated with a class. As part of a class, a method defines a particular behavior of a class instance. A class can have more than one method.</dd>
